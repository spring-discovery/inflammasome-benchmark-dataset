# Spring Inflammasome Benchmark Dataset

Spring conducted a phenotypic, high content imaging screen on inflammasome activated primary human PBMCs using a library of bioactive small molecules to identify novel inflammasome inhibitors. Using images from these phenotypic datasets, we developed novel machine learning tools to build profiles of various states of inflammasome activation and inhibition that facilitated identification of compound hits. This analytical toolkit includes a mixture of automated analyses of targeted cell biological features, deep learning classification models, and compound similarity metrics.

This dataset is designed to benchmark the compound similarity method by allowing measurements of inherent sources of variability such as donors, plates, and experimental runs. We used a bespoke library of 623 compounds, profiled in 4 batches of 8 plates each for a total of 16 donors.
