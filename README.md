# Spring Inflammasome Benchmark Dataset

Spring conducted a phenotypic, high content imaging screen on inflammasome activated primary human PBMCs using a library of bioactive small molecules to identify novel inflammasome inhibitors. Using images from these phenotypic datasets, we established a computational method to score phenotypic similarity in order to identify compounds that are likely biologically related.

This dataset is designed to benchmark the compound similarity method by allowing measurements of inherent sources of variability such as donors, plates, and experimental runs. We used a bespoke library of 623 compounds, profiled in 4 batches of 8 plates each across a total of 16 donors.
